# Overview

**JuliaDB is a package for working with persistent data sets.**

We recognized the need for an all-Julia, end-to-end tool that can

1. Load multi-dimensional datasets quickly and incrementally.
2. Index the data and perform filter, aggregate, sort and join operations.
3. Save results and load them efficiently later.
4. Readily use Julia's built-in [parallelism](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/parallel-computing/) to fully utilize any machine or cluster.

We built JuliaDB to fill this void.

JuliaDB provides distributed table and array datastructures with convenient functions to load data from CSV. JuliaDB is Julia all the way down. This means queries can be composed with Julia code that may use a vast ecosystem of packages.


## Quickstart

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("JuliaDB")

using JuliaDB

# Create a table where the first column is the "primary key"
t = table(rand(Bool, 10), rand(10), pkey=1)
```

## Parallelism

The parallel/distributed features of JuliaDB are available by either:

1. Starting Julia with `N` workers: `julia -p N`
2. Calling `addprocs(N)` before `using JuliaDB`

!!! note
    Multiple processes may not be beneficial for datasets with less than a few million rows.
