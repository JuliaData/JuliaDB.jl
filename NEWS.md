## v0.7.0

- **(breaking)** `groupby` and `groupreduce` now select all but the grouped columns (as opposed to all columns) (#120)
- **(feature)** `usekey=true` keyword argument to `groupby` will cause the grouping function to be called with two arguments: the grouping key, and the selected subset of records. (#120)
- **(breaking)** leftjoin and outerjoin, operations don't speculatively create `DataValueArray` anymore. It will be created if there are some keys which do not have a corresponding match in the other table. (#121)
- **(feature)** `Not`, `Join`, `Between` and `Function` selectors have been added.

## v0.8.0

- **(breaking)** Uses new redisigned version of OnlineStats
    - **(breaking)** Does not wrap OnlineStats in Series wrapper. (IndexedTables.jl#149) this means `m = reduce(Mean(), t, select=:x)` will return a `Mean` object rather than a `Series(Mean())` object. Also `value(m) == 0.45` for example, rather than `value(m) == (0.45,)`
- **(feature)** - `view` works with logical indexes now (IndexedTables#134)


## v0.9.0

- **(breaking)** Missing values represented as `Union{T,Missing}` rather than `DataValue`.

## v0.10.0

- **(breaking)** Support for both `Missing` and `DataValue` representations of missing data.
    - Defaults to `Missing`.  functions that can create missing values have been given a `missingtype = Missing` keyword argument.
